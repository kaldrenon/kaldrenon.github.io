```
open arms (wide)
  open smile (charming)
    open heart (full)
      open book (enchanting)

vibrant and shimmering
bold and determined
prepared to
  laugh
  cry
  cheer
  protect

without hesitation

a beacon (bright)
  a bastion (sturdy)
        a blessing (pure)
      a beginning (new)

what an astonishing thing
  to find here
  of all places

  closer than I expected
considering the distance
```
