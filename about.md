Hi! I'm Andrew. I tend to go by Kaldrenon on the internet - it's a name I originally made up for an RPG character in 8th grade or so, and I really like it, so it stuck. Odds are pretty good that if you see the username Kaldrenon, it's me!

I do a lot of things, but some especially often. For example: I'm a web developer by day, a gamer by night, and a D&D enthusiast by the grace of God. I love Jesus a lot, I love you a lot too, and you will often find me expressing ideas to that effect [over on the Tweetums](http://twitter.com/kaldrenon).
